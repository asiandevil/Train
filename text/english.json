Unfortunately, his son has not the best reputation and on this significant day he also distinguished himself. At the opening ceremony, the Magnate's son was making a speech, but to great disappointment it was interrupted by none other than the man making it! Suddenly, to the surprise of all present, the Magnate's son, Joseph Schiller, accused one of those present of making an attempt on his life. Joseph himself claimed that the man was a member of a notorious radical terrorist organization. Unfortunately, poor Prince Joseph was unaware that the government had officially announced the complete destruction of this organization.”"
